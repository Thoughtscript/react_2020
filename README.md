This repo demonstrates how to use ReactJS to validate, batch, and send emails. It uses some of the newer React concepts like [*hooks*](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html), uses webpack 4.40+ for [*basic minification*](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/uglifyjs-webpack-plugin/) and [*style processing*](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/mini-css-extract-plugin/), and the absence of Redux.
